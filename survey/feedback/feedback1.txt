Your research statement is clear enough for me to grasp what the paper is all about. I like the graph of Fig. 1. about Code smell research literature production from 2002 to 2016. It clearly shows the evolution of the problem since 2002. 
Do your findings show that this trend will continue, if yes, then it may be a good thing to mention it in your paper. 
Since you are not sure of who is going to review your paper, I suggest that you define the main term (code smell) early enough, so as to refresh the reader's memory. The Introduction of the paper may be a good place to define the main term. The abstract by IEEE standard is bold, you may bold the abstract to distinguish it from the rest of the text at first glance. 
The paper's introduction says Code smells are similar to antipatterns, but code smells may not always be bad. In what circumstances are they not bad? 
Make sure that the claim in the Introduction that "There are almost no relevant papers before 2016" is justifiable. I attached the version of the paper that I reviewed.

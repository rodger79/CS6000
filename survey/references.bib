	abstract = {As a type of anti-pattern, test smells are defined as poorly designed tests and their presence may negatively affect the quality of test suites and production code. Test smells are the subject of active discussions among practitioners and researchers, and various guidelines to handle smells are constantly offered for smell prevention, smell detection, and smell correction. Since there is a vast grey literature as well as a large body of research studies in this domain, it is not practical for practitioners and researchers to locate and synthesize such a large literature. Motivated by the above need and to find out what we, as the community, know about smells in test code, we conducted a ‘multivocal’ literature mapping (classification) on both the scientific literature and also practitioners’ grey literature. By surveying all the sources on test smells in both industry (120 sources) and academia (46 sources), 166 sources in total, our review presents the largest catalogue of test smells, along with the summary of guidelines/techniques and the tools to deal with those smells. This article aims to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) by serving as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in this important area, and by helping them develop high-quality test scripts, and minimize occurrences of test smells and their negative consequences in large test automation projects.},

	abstract = {Background. Architectural smells and code smells are symptoms of bad code or design that can cause different quality problems, such as faults, technical debt, or difficulties with maintenance and evolution. Some studies show that code smells and architectural smells often appear together in the same file. The correlation between code smells and architectural smells, however, is not clear yet; some studies on a limited set of projects have claimed that architectural smells can be derived from code smells, while other studies claim the opposite. Objective. The goal of this work is to understand whether architectural smells are independent from code smells or can be derived from a code smell or from one category of them. Method. We conducted a case study analyzing the correlations among 19 code smells, six categories of code smells, and four architectural smells. Results. The results show that architectural smells are correlated with code smells only in a very low number of occurrences and therefore cannot be derived from code smells. Conclusion. Architectural smells are independent from code smells, and therefore deserve special attention by researchers, who should investigate their actual harmfulness, and practitioners, who should consider whether and when to remove them.},

	abstract = {Code smells indicate possible flaws in software design, that could negatively affect system’s maintainability. Interactions among smells located in the same classes (i.e., collocated smells) have even more detrimental effect on quality. Extracted frequent patterns of collocated smells could help to understand practical consequences of collocations. In this paper we identify and empirically validate frequent collocations of 14 code smells detected in 92 Java systems, using three approaches: pairwise correlation analysis, PCA and associative rules. To cross-validate the results, we used up to 6 detectors for each smell. Additionally, we examine and compare techniques used to extract the relationships. The contribution is three-fold: (1) we identify and empirically validate relationships among the examined code smells on a large dataset that we made publicly available, (2) we discuss how the choice of code smell detectors affects results, and (3) we analyze the impact of software domain on existence of the smell collocations. Additionally, we found that analytical methods we used to discover collocations, are complementary. Smells collocations display recurring patterns that could help prioritizing the classes affected by code smells to be refactored and developing or enhancing detectors exploiting information about collocations. They can also help the developers focusing on classes deserving more maintenance effort.},

	abstract = {Performance issues in mobile applications (i.e., apps) often have a direct impact on the user experience. However, due to limited testing resources and fast-paced software development cycles, many performance issues remain undiscovered when the apps are released. As found by a prior study, these performance issues are one of the most common complaints that app users have. Unfortunately, there is a limited support to help developers avoid or detect performance issues in mobile apps. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on performance issues in iOS apps written in Swift language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on performance issues of apps on the iOS platform. We manually studied 225 performance issues that are collected from four open source iOS apps. We found that most performance issues in iOS apps are related to inefficient UI design, memory issues, and inefficient thread handling. We also manually uncovered four performance anti-patterns that recurred in the studied issue reports. To help developers avoid these performance anti-patterns in the code, we implemented a static analysis tool called iPerfDetector. We evaluated iPerfDetector on eight open source and three commercial apps. iPerfDetector successfully detected 34 performance anti-pattern instances in the studied apps, where 31 of them are already confirmed and accepted by developers as potential performance issues. Our case study on the performance impact of the anti-patterns shows that fixing the anti-pattern may improve the performance (i.e., response time, GPU, or CPU) of the workload by up to 80\%.},

	abstract = {Context Open standards are urgently needed for enabling software interoperability in Cloud Computing. Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) provides a set of best design principles to create interoperable REST management APIs. Although OCCI is the only standard addressing the management of any kind of cloud resources, it does not support a range of best principles related to REST design. This often worsens REST API quality by decreasing their understandability and reusability. Objective We aim at assisting cloud developers to enhance their REST management APIs by providing a compliance evaluation of OCCI and REST best principles and a recommendation support to comply with these principles. Method First, we leverage patterns and anti-patterns to drive respectively the good and poor practices of OCCI and REST best principles. Then, we propose a semantic-based approach for defining and detecting REST and OCCI (anti)patterns and providing a set of correction recommendations to comply with both REST and OCCI best principles. We validated this approach by applying it on cloud REST APIs and evaluating its accuracy, usefulness and extensibility. Results We found that our approach accurately detects OCCI and REST(anti)patterns and provides useful recommendations. According to the compliance results, we reveal that there is no widespread adoption of OCCI principles in existing APIs. In contrast, these APIs have reached an acceptable level of maturity regarding REST principles. Conclusion Our approach provides an effective and extensible technique for defining and detecting OCCI and REST (anti)patterns in Cloud REST APIs.

One of the most efficient ones is software refactoring to eliminate bad-smells. A majority of existing work propose “standard” refactoring solutions that can be applied by hand for each kind of defect. However, it is difficult to prove or ensure the generality of these solutions to any kind of bad-smells or software codes. In this paper, we propose an approach to correct bad-smells using well-designed code. We use genetic algorithms to generate correction solutions defined as a combination of refactoring operations that maximize, as much as possible, the similarity between the corrected bad-smells and examples of well-designed code. We report the results of an evaluation of our approach using four open-source projects. Our proposal achieved high correction scores by fixing the majority of expected bad-smells.},

A comparison of the proposed SPOA algorithm is performed with nine competing optimization algorithms over 23 benchmark test functions. The proposed SPOA is further hybridized with B-J48 pruned machine-learning approach for efficiently detecting the code smells from the data set.

	abstract = {Background Software fault prediction is the process of developing models that can be used by the software practitioners in the early phases of software development life cycle for detecting faulty constructs such as modules or classes. There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work.},

Machine learning techniques have been used for different topics in software engineering, e.g., design pattern detection, code smell detection, bug prediction, recommending systems. In this paper, we focus our attention on the classification of code smell severity through the use of machine learning techniques in different experiments. The severity of code smells is an important factor to take into consideration when reporting code smell detection results, since it allows the prioritization of refactoring efforts. In fact, code smells with high severity can be particularly large and complex, and create larger issues to the maintainability of software a system. In our experiments, we apply several machine learning models, spanning from multinomial classification to regression, plus a method to apply binary classifiers for ordinal classification. In fact, we model code smell severity as an ordinal variable. We take the baseline models from previous work, where we applied binary classification models for code smell detection with good results. We report and compare the performance of the models according to their accuracy and four different performance measures used for the evaluation of ordinal classification techniques. From our results, while the accuracy of the classification of severity is not high as in the binary classification of absence or presence of code smells, the ranking correlation of the actual and predicted severity for the best models reaches 0.88–0.96, measured through Spearman’s ρ.},

We found that all algorithms achieved high performances in the cross-validation data set, yet the highest performances were obtained by J48 and Random Forest, while the worst performance were achieved by support vector machines. However, the lower prevalence of code smells, i.e., imbalanced data, in the entire data set caused varying performances that need to be addressed in the future studies.

	abstract = {Background: Code smells indicate suboptimal design or implementation choices in the source code that often lead it to be more change- and fault-prone. Researchers defined dozens of code smell detectors, which exploit different sources of information to support developers when diagnosing design flaws. Despite their good accuracy, previous work pointed out three important limitations that might preclude the use of code smell detectors in practice: (i) subjectiveness of developers with respect to code smells detected by such tools, (ii) scarce agreement between different detectors, and (iii) difficulties in finding good thresholds to be used for detection. To overcome these limitations, the use of machine learning techniques represents an ever increasing research area. Objective: While the research community carefully studied the methodologies applied by researchers when defining heuristic-based code smell detectors, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge on how machine learning approaches have been adopted for code smell detection and whether there are points of improvement to allow a better detection of code smells. Our goal is to provide an overview and discuss the usage of machine learning approaches in the field of code smells. Method: This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Machine Learning Techniques for Code Smell Detection. Our work considers papers published between 2000 and 2017. Starting from an initial set of 2456 papers, we found that 15 of them actually adopted machine learning approaches. We studied them under four different perspectives: (i) code smells considered, (ii) setup of machine learning approaches, (iii) design of the evaluation strategies, and (iv) a meta-analysis on the performance achieved by the models proposed so far. Results: The analyses performed show that God Class, Long Method, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti Code have been heavily considered in the literature. Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines are the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for code smell detection. Models based on a large set of independent variables have performed well. JRip and Random Forest are the most effective classifiers in terms of performance. The analyses also reveal the existence of several open issues and challenges that the research community should focus on in the future. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we argue that there is still room for the improvement of machine learning techniques in the context of code smell detection. The open issues emerged in this study can represent the input for researchers interested in developing more powerful techniques.},

	abstract = {Context Software refactoring is a common practice aimed at addressing requirements or fixing bugs during the software development. While refactoring related to functional requirements has been widely studied in the last few years, non-functional-driven refactoring is still critical, mostly because non-functional characteristics of software are hard to assess and appropriate refactoring actions can be difficult to identify. In the context of performance, which is the focus of this paper, antipatterns represent effective instruments to tackle this issue, because they document common mistakes leading to performance problems as well as their solutions. Objective In order to effectively reuse the knowledge beyond performance antipatterns, automation is required to detect and remove them. In this paper we introduce a framework that enables, in an unique tool context, the refactoring of software models driven by performance antipattern detection and removal. Method We have implemented, within the EPSILON platform, detection rules and refactoring actions on UML models for a set of well-known performance antipatterns. By exploiting the EPSILON languages to check properties and apply refactoring on models, we enable three types of refactoring sessions. Results We experiment our framework on a Botanical Garden Management System to show, on one side, that antipatterns can effectively drive software refactoring towards models that satisfy performance requirements and, on the other side, that the automation introduced by EPSILON-based sessions enables to inspect multiple paths and to propose a variety of solutions. Conclusion This work demonstrates that automation in performance-driven software model refactoring can be beneficial, and that performance antipatterns can be powerful instruments in the hands of software engineers for detecting (and solving) performance problems usually hidden to traditional bottleneck analysis. This work also opens the road to the integration of well-known techniques for software refactoring driven by functional requirements with novel techniques addressing non-functional requirements like performance.},

	abstract = {Software defect prediction is one of the most popular research topics in software engineering. It aims to predict defect-prone software modules before defects are discovered, therefore it can be used to better prioritise software quality assurance effort. In recent years, especially for recent 3 years, many new defect prediction studies have been proposed. The goal of this study is to comprehensively review, analyse and discuss the state-of-the-art of defect prediction. The authors survey almost 70 representative defect prediction papers in recent years (January 2014–April 2017), most of which are published in the prominent software engineering journals and top conferences. The selected defect prediction papers are summarised to four aspects: machine learning-based prediction algorithms, manipulating the data, effort-aware prediction and empirical studies. The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building methods and many research opportunities exist. The identified challenges can give some practical guidelines for both software engineering researchers and practitioners in future software defect prediction.},

Artificial intelligence techniques have been applied in several ways to improve soft-ware quality in code smells detection i.e. (detection rules or standards using a combination of object-oriented metrics and Bayesian inference graphs). Literature in the field has identified artificial intelligence techniques and compare different artificial intelligence algorithms, which are used in the detection of code smells. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a systematic literature review devoted to study in deep the interaction of these fields. In this paper, authors conduct a systematic mapping to get to know how artificial intelligence inter-acts with code smells. Results show the deep connection of Artificial Intelligence with code smells in a solid way, as well as, providing potential challenges and opportunities for future research.},

In terms of techniques, machine learning (ML) has been successfully used in many real-world problems such as software vulnerability detection, malware detection and function recognition, for high-quality feature representation learning. In this paper, we propose a performance evaluation study on ML based solutions for software vulnerability detection, conducting three experiments: machine learning-based techniques for software vulnerability detection based on the scenario of single type of vulnerability and multiple types of vulnerabilities per dataset; machine learning-based techniques for cross-project software vulnerability detection; and software vulnerability detection when facing the class imbalance problem with varying imbalance ratios. Experimental results show that it is possible to employ software vulnerability detection based on ML techniques. However, ML-based techniques suffer poor performance on both cross-project and class imbalance problem in software vulnerability detection.},

	abstract = {To expose software as Web-accesible services, Web Service technologies demand developers to implement certain sofware artifacts, such as the service description using WSDL. Therefore, developers usually use automatic tools to perform this task, which take as input a code written in a programming language –e.g. Java– and generate the necessary artifacts for invoking it remotely. However, as a result of tool flaws and some bad coding practices, the description of the resulting Web Services might contain anti-patterns that difficult their discovery and use. In earlier work we proposed a tool-supported, code-first approach named Gapidt to develop Web Services in Java while early reducing the presence of anti-patterns in their descriptions through code refactorings. Bad coding practices, which potentially reduce the textual and structural information of generated WSDL documents, are automatically detected and informed to the developer by means of the GAnalyzer module so he/she can fix the service code. Moreover, developer provided information, such as service parameter names and operation comments, as well as re-utilization of data-type definitions, are exploited by the GMapper module upon generating WSDL documents. This paper focuses on a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the approach oriented at prospective users to assess expected discoverability gains and usage considerations taking into account various relevant service publishing technologies. In addition, we introduce a detailed comparison of Gapidt with a similar approach from the literature. The results show that Gapidt outperforms its competitor in terms of discoverability while improves Web Service description quality (better documentation and data-models). The Web Service discoverability levels of Gapidt outperforms that of third-party tools, either when using the GAnalyzer plus the GMapper, or only the GMapper.},

\section{Overview}
For my area I'm looking at Anti-Patterns in code, these are also known as code smells. I've also seen them referred to as Atoms of Confusion and nano patterrns.

\section{Journal Entry}
This week I continued working on the draft paper. I primarily reviewed and integrated the feedback I recieved. One of the anonymous feedback providers gave me feedback on someone else's paper (Industrial Control Systems). So I am missing some of the feedback. 

Between Prof Boult's feedback and the student, they agreed on some issues that would help to clarify the paper.

There were also some consistency issues to correct, and by moving some things around in the paper it could help to provide clearer understanding. Specifically, explaining some of the concepts early on before they are discussed is helpful.

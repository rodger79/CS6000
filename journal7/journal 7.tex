\section{Overview}
For my area I'm looking at Anti-Patterns in code, these are also known as code smells. I've also seen them referred to as Atoms of Confusion and nano patterrns.

\section{Journal Entry}
This week I continued working on the draft paper, I was so focused on that that I actually forgot to complete this journal entry, so I apoligzie for the late entry. I feel like I'm on track to finish a good draft this weekend. The only negative I'm encountering is that I think I might be trashing too many papers. I have ~75 I'm using. On the plus side, I was only looking at very recent papers, 2018-2019.
If I go to 2016-2017 I'm sure I'll find a lot of relelvant ones.

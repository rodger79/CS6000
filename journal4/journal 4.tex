\section{Overview}
For my area I'm looking at Anti-Patterns in code, these are also known as code smells. I've also seen them referred to as Atoms of Confusion and nano patterrns.

\section{Journal Entry}
For my learning process so far, I've looked at how to use google scholar to optimize my time looking for the latest research.
Up until this class I would go onto the UCCS library website and use the research databases to find papers. 
It has been very helpful to set up my google scholar profile to automatically show the papers I can download through my UCCS credentails.
I have a couple of things on my to-do list.
I need to speak with Prof Boult about how to get a private github as a student, as that would be very useful, and I have a handful of questions I would like to get his opinion on. 

\section{Journal 4}
\subsection{Who is the Main Character}
The main character is the anti-pattern. I need to find a way to clearly define the anti-pattern. 
There are some authors who define it as interchangeable as a code smell. 
I don't think that is correct. 
I think code smells are precursors to anti-patterns. 
Meaning that an anti-pattern is a known bad problem, where a code smell may lead to a problem. 
\subsection{What Character Traits Make them Interesting}
What's interesting about anti-patterns is that they have a very human aspect to them. 
They overlap the way humans think with the way code is written. 
They connect common ways of human misunderstanding to software development. 
Personally, I think most developers expect code to work as they understand it to. 
They don't spend a lot of time thinking about how code will work in ways they don't expect.
It is in the nature of most engineers to see things in mathematical/binary ways and ignore the human aspects to what they are working on.
